State Variables:
- robot position, heading & velocity (all 4 robots) with covariance
- robot configuration (our 2 robots)
    - robot mass, moment of inertia
    - loading (nb & type of elements)
    - arm loading (type of element)
- fire position & orientation(standing / level(colour)) with variance
    - for some fires (the ones being currently manipulated):
        - orientation & position in 3D with complete covariance matrix
- fruit presence & colour (probabilities)
- score estimate
- time since game start (special variable)
